# ArchTechnology Internship Projects

Welcome to the official repository for my internship projects at **ArchTechnology**.  
This repository contains all the work, code, and analysis done during the internship period, focused primarily on **machine learning model building, data preprocessing, and evaluation**.

---

## üîç Project Overview

The goal of the internship was to:
- Load and clean datasets
- Handle nulls, duplicates, and outliers
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Encode categorical variables
- Scale features for optimal model performance
- Train classification models
- Evaluate models using accuracy score and confusion matrix

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Done So Far

### ‚úîÔ∏è 1. Data Loading and Inspection
- Loaded dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Checked for null values and duplicates.
- Cleaned the data accordingly.

### ‚úîÔ∏è 2. Outlier Detection & Removal
- Visualized data using box plots.
- Removed outliers using IQR and optionally via `feature-engine`.

### ‚úîÔ∏è 3. Data Encoding & Feature Engineering
- Applied encoding using `sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder` or `OneHotEncoder`.
- Performed necessary transformations to prepare the dataset for ML models.

### ‚úîÔ∏è 4. Feature Scaling
- Used `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` to normalize features.
- Ensured all features are on the same scale for better model performance.

### ‚úîÔ∏è 5. Model Training
- Used `RandomForestClassifier` from `sklearn.ensemble`.
- Split data into training and test sets using `train_test_split`.

### ‚úîÔ∏è 6. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the model using:
  - `accuracy_score`
  - `confusion_matrix`
- Achieved **100% accuracy** on the test set (note: dataset had only 150 records).

## üîß Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Feature-engine (for outlier detection)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## üìà Results

The current model achieved:
Accuracy: 1.0
Confusion Matrix:
[[ 10 0 0 ]
[  0 9 0  ]
[  0 0 11 ]]

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Tune hyperparameters and compare other models
- Try cross-validation for more robust performance estimates
- Save models using `joblib` or `pickle`
- Explore deployment options or integration into a larger pipeline

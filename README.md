# ArchTechnology-Internship-Projects

This repository contains the work I completed as part of my internship at ArchTechnology. The focus was on:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Outlier detection and handling
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Building and evaluating classification models
- Using Python libraries such as Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib

Each notebook or script represents a milestone in the data science pipeline, from raw data to model evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
